# React exercise - Internet Programming Course
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You need to add relevant npm libraries and of course run npm install.
You are given sample images for the project in the public folder. Feel free to use them or replace them with your own images.

## General Information

The Memory Game Application is a web-based game designed to test and improve users' memory skills. Players can flip cards to reveal hidden images and try to match pairs within a set of cards.

### Features

- Enter your name to start the game.
- Adjust game settings such as the number of rows, columns, and delay.
- Flip cards to find matching pairs.
- View leaderboard scores to track your performance.
- Abandon the game at any time.

### Technologies

- React.js
- React Bootstrap
- React Router

### Target Audience

This project is suitable for users of all ages who enjoy playing memory games and want to challenge their cognitive abilities.

### Scope

The Memory Game Application covers the basic functionality of a memory game, including card flipping, matching pairs, and score tracking. It does not include advanced features such as multiplayer support or complex game mechanics.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
